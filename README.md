# aweber_assignment
This is my first response to an interview process request from AWeber to show some snakelike abilities.
That was my first python joke. Be prepared for worse.

As of now this repository has no unit test so we are utilizing main.py as a driver to produce results from functionality of class widgetDbCore. This includes all CRUD methodology such as:
create
read
update (via several different means)
and delete.

To observe the performance of this functionality, simply execute the following:
python3 main.py

The screenout should describe the before and after of each method.
